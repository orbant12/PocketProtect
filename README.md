# Skin Screen 

#### `This project repo is a failed startup, helping others with my 1.5 year of work` 
 - It was running on appstore and AWS EC2 for 4 months.
 - It was helped by Vrije University of Amsterdam's startup program DemonstratorLab. More about them: https://www.demonstratorlab.nl
   
 - Cause of failiure: Low Demand with High Competition
